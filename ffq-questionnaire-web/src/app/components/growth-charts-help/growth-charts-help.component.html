  <h3>Child Personal Information</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      The Child Personal Information panel is used to identify which child of
      the partent will be selected to display or modify the child's information.
      The Child Personal panel has to menus: Children and Gender. Both menus are
      required, meaning that for interacting with the other panels it is
      necessary to fill up the data in the Child Personal Information Panel
      first. The menu Children allows the parent to select the child first name,
      and the menu Gender identifies which charts must be displayed. The data
      for the charts are different depending on the gender selected.

  <h3>Child Body Measurements</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      The Child Body Measurements panel is used to determine the type of units
      of measurements to use, add and save data along the time of the children
      as height and weight to plot them on the different type of charts. The
      data of charts is retrieve from the World Health Organization and by
      default is expressed in Centimeters and Kilograms. That being said, to
      facilitate a better compression of the units below you can find a
      conversion table:
    </p>
  </div>

  <table mat-table [dataSource]="dataSource" class="mat-elevation-z8">
    <!--- Note that these columns can be defined in any order.
          The actual rendered columns are set as a property on the row definition" -->

    <!-- Position Column -->
    <ng-container matColumnDef="position">
      <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef>No.</th>
      <td mat-cell *matCellDef="let element">{{ element.position }}</td>
    </ng-container>

    <!-- from Column -->
    <ng-container matColumnDef="from">
      <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef>US Customary System</th>
      <td mat-cell *matCellDef="let element">{{ element.from }}</td>
    </ng-container>

    <!-- to Column -->
    <ng-container matColumnDef="to">

  <div>
    <p>
      The data required consit of age, height and weight of the child. The wight
      cannot be lesser than 1 kilogram or greater than 30 Kilograms. The height
      cannot be lesser than 40 centimeters and greater than 110 centimeters.

  <div>
    <p>
      Changing the unit of measurements to US Customary System and recalculating
      the minimum and maximum weight values as 2 and 66 pounds. Doing the same
      for the height we got 15 inches as minimum and 43 inches as maximum.

  <div>
    <p>
      The valid values for age are on the interval from zero month to 24 months.

      All the data is required, meaning that it cannot be incompleted in order
      to plot it on the charts or to save it in the database.
    </p>

  <div>
    <p>
      It is recommendable to use the Metric System to work with the charts
      becuase it is standardized around the world. However, you can feel free to
      use US Customary System or a combination of Metric System and US Customary
      System. That being said, the formula for BMI using the Metric System is
      slightly different to the formula of BMI using the US Customary System.
    </p>
    <pre>BMI formula using Metric System:           BMI =  kg/m<sup>2</sup></pre>
    <pre>BMI formula using US Customary System:     BMI = (lb*703))/in<sup>2</sup></pre>
    <p>
      The kg refers to the weight in kilograms and m<sup>2</sup> to the squared
      height of the child in meters. It is important to point out that 1 meter
      (m) is equal to 100 cm. Due to the child's height is in centimeters then
      it is necessary to convert the centimeters to meters. The same is
      applicable to The BMI formula using the US Customary System interchanging
      the units of measurements

    <p>
      The button add will be activated once all the data necessary is entered.
      However, it cannot be added if the data is outside of the valid domain.
      Adding a point will add a new point to the chart or modify one in case
      there is one with the same month. That being said, it is important to
      notice that adding a point will not save the data in the database, so all
      the changes will be lost in case the data is not saved.
    </p>
  </div>
  <img

  <div>
    <p>
      The save button will be acctivated once the add button is triggered. The
      save button will save all the point added or modified by the user.

  <h3>Chart Options</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      The Chart Options Panel provides four types of charts: BMI, Height-Age,
      Weight-Age and Weight-Height. All the charts will plot the data on an
      interval from zero to twenty four months except the Weight-Height chart.
      In order to retrived the interpretation of the charts in a specific point
      it is necessary to click on it.
